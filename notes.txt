gcloud init 

It lets you select the project from the google cloud platform.
Is is a everytime process as I can see the associated project with this init command. How does it go?



Use this command to generate the requirements.txt file
pip3 freeze > requirements.txt 



handlers:
-   url: /static
    static_dir: static
    
-   url /.*
    script: auto
